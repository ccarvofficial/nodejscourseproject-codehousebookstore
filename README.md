# Code House - The Bookstore
> A Node.js Project.

## About
This project was developed on the platform node that allows the development of backend applications using a javascript language. The name of the project is Code House, a bookstore with fundamental resources found in the most diverse projects. Being a backend javascript application, it is possible to receive browser requirements and return responses via the famous HTTP protocol. Its main functionality consists of a list of books in which the user can add, remove, edit data among other features. It was applied "Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)" to make the code cleaner and readable beyond the Dao designs patterns. I followed the documentation avaliable in [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).

## Automatic Tasks
- ``` $ npm start ```  Runs the app in the development mode.
- ``` $ npm test ```  Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
- ``` $ npm run build ```  Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
- ``` $ npm run eject ```  If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**
